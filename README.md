# Radiance

### What is Radiance?
Radiance is a personal-use quantitative analysis program currently in development. Using Python, it aims to gather financial data through many methods including financial data APIs (eg. AlphaVantage, Quandl)  and webscraping. This data will be stored locally using SQLite. The data can be accessed and analyzed in order to aid in the process of selecting investment opportunities.
